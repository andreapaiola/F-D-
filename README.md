Generic infos
--------------

SEE EXAMPLES IN "examples" DIRECTORY -insert mind blown here-

PARAMETERS:

FadePaid start: it's the second that all start to fade away, since the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT)  
default: next week

FadePaid end: now it's gone
default: a week later


Before FadePaid start nothing happens, opacity is 1

After FadePaid end you are blind, but the universe still exists?

FadePaid start : FadePaid end = 1 : 0


PHP info
---------

Include "fade.php" in your <body> tag as in index.php example

OOP why not


JAVASCRIPT infos
-----------------
